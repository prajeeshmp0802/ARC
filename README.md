# The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)

This repository contains the ARC task data, as well as a browser-based interface for humans to try their hand at solving the tasks manually.

*"ARC can be seen as a general artificial intelligence benchmark, as a program synthesis benchmark, or as a psychometric intelligence test. It is targeted at both humans and artificially intelligent systems that aim at emulating a human-like form of general fluid intelligence."*

********* Summary ************
Used basic Python and Numpy arrays.Store and process use Â python basic data structures such as
set /dictionary ,list (mostly). Total 4 solutions obtained in which 3 solutions use loop iterative model to find values 
in column wise and row wise.Among 4 solutions one required matrix rotation other3 was just the pattern and color as expected
To find the pattern & color
